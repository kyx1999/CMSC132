            <strong>Project:</strong> Blackjack<br>
            <strong>Due Date:</strong> Wednesday, Sep 11, 11:30 pm<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project you will write a class named <b>Blackjack</b> that
        implements the game logic associated with a blackjack card game. The Blackjack
        class implements the <b>BlackjackEngine</b> Java interface whose definition you
        can find in the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/Blackjack/doc/index.html">project's javadoc documentation</a>.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong>
        Unlike other class projects, for this project you are allowed to discuss or
        receive help from your classmates, but you may not exchange any code.
        Every student must implement their own code. If you are assisted by a student
        add the name of the student to the top of the Blackjack.java file.
    </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project will give you practice using classes, ArrayList
        and other fundamental Java constructs.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a one-week project, however, we are
            providing almost two weeks for those students adding the course late.
            You should plan to finish the project in a week.
        </li>
        <li>The project's deadline is 11:30 pm, even though you will see 11:31 pm
            in the submit server.  We need to use 11:31 pm as a project submitted
            exactly at 11:30 pm will be considered late by the submit server.
        </li>
        <li>
            It takes time for a project to be tested in the submit server, especially
            the day the project is due.  Keep this mind.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>You need to submit often so you have a backup copy in the submit server.
            </strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            In this course we grade the highest scoring submission after a
            late penalty has been applied (in case you have a late submission).  <strong>
            The submission selected does not take into account any documentation requirements
            </strong> therefore you need to complete documentation requirements as you
            implement the project. If you don't, you may get a low score in a project. For example,
            you could have one submission that has 70 pts of tests points and no documentation,
            and a second one with 60 pts of tests points and documentation (20 pts). We will
            grade the first one and not the second (which will give you a higher grade) as we
            select from the submit server the one with the highest tests score.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should have received a message indicating you are part of Piazza.  If not,
            contact your lab / discussion TA.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(55%) Public Tests</li>
        <li>(15%) Release Tests</li>
        <li><strong>(20%) Secret Tests </strong></li>
        <li>(10%) Style</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good Faith Attempt</h2>
    <p>
        Remember you need to satisfy a good faith attempt for every project.
        The good faith attempt for this project is the set of public tests. The deadline
        to satisfy this requirement will be posted later on.
    </p>


    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>
    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/Blackjack.zip">Blackjack.zip</a>.
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A package called <b>blackjackGUI - </b>This package implements the game's
            Graphical User Interface.&nbsp; You don't have to modify nor add anything to
            this package.&nbsp; We have provided the source code in case you are
            interested to see how it works.&nbsp; In this package you will find a class
            named <b>PlayBlackjack </b>which is the class you will execute if you want
            to play the game through the GUI.
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>blackjack</b> - In this package you will find the
            shell for a class named <b>Blackjack</b> that implements the blackjack game
            logic.&nbsp; This is the class you need to implement for this project.&nbsp;
            In the blackjack package you will also find the following support classes:
            <b>Card</b>, <b>CardSuit</b> <b>and CardValue</b>.&nbsp; You will use these
            classes during the implementation of the the Blackjack class; you should not
            modify these classes.
        </li>

        <li><b>PublicTests.java</b> - This class represents the set of JUnit public
            tests. The expected results for each test can be found in the text files
            with a "pub" prefix.&nbsp; This class can be found in the <b>tests</b>
            package.
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>tests </b>- Includes the public tests (<b>PublicTests.java) </b>
            and a shell for a class (StudentTests.java).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <h3>Blackjack Rules</h3>

    <p>If you have been to Vegas, you are familiar with the rules to play
        blackjack (also known as 21).&nbsp; However, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,
        therefore the rules for blackjack in this project are different.&nbsp; If you want to
        familiarize yourself with the game, check the online blackjack game available
        at <a href="http://www.247blackjack.com/">http://www.247blackjack.com/</a>.&nbsp; <b>Note
            the rules we will use are not exactly the same ones used by this online game.</b>
    </p>

    <p>In our blackjack version we have a dealer (person who shuffles and distribute
        cards) and only one player.&nbsp; The game's objective is for the player to beat the
        dealer by generating a hand of cards whose value is higher than the dealer's
        hand without exceeding a total value of 21.&nbsp; The game starts by the dealer
        shuffling cards (one or more decks) and dealing two cards to the player and
        herself/himself (the actual order is described in the
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/Blackjack/doc/index.html">project's javadoc documentation</a>).&nbsp; One of
        the dealer's cards will be face down.&nbsp; At this point the player will ask
        for cards until he/she believes it can beat the dealer with the current hand
        and as long the cards' total value does not exceed 21.&nbsp; If the hand of
        cards does not exceed 21, and the player stops requesting cards (what is referred
        to as "stand"), then the dealer will flip the card that was face down, and
        proceed to deal cards to herself/himself as long as the cards' value is less
        than 16 and does not exceed 21.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a value greater than 21 is
        generated the player wins.&nbsp; Otherwise whoever (player or dealer) has the
        hand with the highest value will win the game.&nbsp; The following provides
        additional information about the game:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The term "bust" refers to the scenario where the player or dealer cards'
            value exceeds 21.
        </li>

        <li>The term "blackjack" refers to the scenario where in a hand of cards we
            have an Ace("1") along with a "10", Jack, Queen or King.&nbsp;
        </li>

        <li>In our blackjack version the player cannot split a hand of cards.&nbsp;
            If you don't know what splitting is, disregard this comment.
        </li>

        <li>The value of cards "2" through "10" correspond to the numeric value
            associated with the card face value.
        </li>

        <li>"1" (Ace) could be worth either 1 or 11.</li>

        <li>The Jack ("J"),&nbsp; Queen("Q")&nbsp; and King("K") are worth 10 points each.</li>

        <li>The card's suit (i.e., "SPADES", "DIAMONDS", "HEARTS", "CLUBS") has no
            bearing on a card's value.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The state of the game is defined by the values: BlackjackEngine.DEALER_WON,
            BlackjackEngine.PLAYER_WON, and BlackjackEngine.GAME_IN_PROGRESS.
        </li>

        <li>Your program should handle more than one deck of cards.</li>

        <li><b>When creating a deck of cards, load the suits in the following order:
            SPADES, DIAMONDS, HEARTS and CLUBS.&nbsp; At the same time, each suit should
            be loaded starting with the ACE, followed by cards with a face value of "2"
            through "10", followed by the "JACK", "QUEEN" and "KING".&nbsp;
        </b>
        </li>

        <li><b>When creating more than one deck of cards, you must load one deck at
            a time using the order specified above.&nbsp; After all the cards have been
            loaded, you can proceed to shuffle them.</b> For instance, a game with
            2 decks of cards is initially created as: Spade Ace, Spade 2, Spade 3,...
            Spade Jack, Spade Queen, Spade King, Diamond Ace ... Diamond King, Heart Ace
            ... Heart King, Club Ace ... Club King, Spade Ace ... Spade King, ...
            Club King
        </li>

        <li>You must use ArrayList objects to represent the player and dealer's
            cards, and the deck.
        </li>

        <li>You must use the <b>shuffle</b> method of the <b>java.util.Collections
        </b>class to perform the data shuffling.&nbsp; You must use the shuffle
            method that takes a list followed by a Random object.&nbsp; Notice that
            the list parameter is defined as List&lt;?&gt;.&nbsp; You can ignore
            that definition.&nbsp; The method will work with ArrayList objects.
        </li>

        <li>A player has an account with an initial value of 200 chips.
        </li>

        <li>The default initial bet is 5 chips.</li>

        <li>When a new game is dealt the bet amount is deducted from the account.</li>

        <li>When a player wins he receives twice the bet amount.</li>

        <li>When a player draws he receives the original bet amount.</li>

        <li>Immediately after checking out the code distribution, make sure you can
            submit your project, even if you have not implemented the project.&nbsp;
            <b>Do not wait until the day the project is due to submit your project for the
                first time.</b>
        </li>

        <li>Verify that your project passes the submit server tests
            (<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2019">https://submit.cs.umd.edu/</a>)
        </li>

        <li>Although we will not grade them, you are welcome and encourage to provide
            your own tests in the in the file <b>StudentTests.java</b>
            provided with the code distribution.
        </li>

        <li>Keep in mind that for this project you have three release tokens in the
            submit server. Information about the test types for CS course can
            be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/testtypes/">Test Types</a>.
        </li>

        <li>Do not define any supporting classes.</li>

        <li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> → If you have a problem with your code
            and need assistance during office hours, you need to have a student
            test(s) that illustrates the problem you are experiencing.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests for this
            project.

        </li>

        <li>We cannot provide any information regarding release nor secret tests.
            Once your project has been graded, you can see a TA if you would
            like to find out why you failed a release or secret test.
