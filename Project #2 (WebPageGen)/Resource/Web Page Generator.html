            <strong>Project:</strong> Web Page Generator<br>
            <strong>Due Date:</strong> Wednesday Sep 18, 11:30 pm<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p> For this project you will develop a set of classes that will
        support the generation of HTML for web pages.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember not to post your project online where others can access it as
        this can lead to academic integrity violations. Also, remember you cannot
        post any code in Piazza.
    </p>
    <p><strong>
        For this project you are allowed to discuss the project with others,
        but you may not exchange any code. Every student must implement their
        own code.
    </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project will allow you to practice inheritance and
        other fundamental Java Constructs.
    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(36%) Public Tests</li>
        <li>(54%) Release Tests</li>
        <li>(10%) Style</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good Faith Attempt</h2>
    <p>
        Remember you need to satisfy a good faith attempt for every project.
        The good faith attempt for this project and its deadline
        will be posted later on.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/WebPageGen.zip">WebPageGen.zip</a>
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A package named <b>model</b> - In this package you will implement
            all the classes for the web page generator. An Utilities.java class has
            been provided with a method to write to files. Feel free to add to the Utilities.java
            class any other methods you understand you need. Notice you will not lose
            any credit if you decide not to add any methods.
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>tests</b> - Includes the public tests (<b>PublicTests.java</b>) and
            a shell for a class where you will write your tests (StudentTests.java). The expected
            results for public tests can be found in the with a "pub" prefix.&nbsp; Remember that
            you can see the results of your tests by adding a System.out.println statement to the
            public tests. To determine why a test is failing, compare the test's output with the
            corresponding .txt file.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For this project you will implement classes that allow us to generate HTML5.
            A description of the classes you need to implement can be found at
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/WebPageGen/doc/index.html">javadoc</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a web page we can have text (represented by the TextElement class) or tags
            (represented by the TagElement class). Both classes implement the Element interface
            that defines a method (genHTML) that generates the expected HTML for the element.
            Tag element classes extend the TagElement class.
        </li>
        <li>
            The WebPage class represents a web page and will put together all the different
            elements. Notice this class implements the Comparable interface.
            For simplicity, the tags associated with doctype, html, head, meta,
            and body will not be generated using classes. One of the method asks to
            create a file with HTML code. We have provide a method that allows you to
            create such a file (see Utilities class).
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to generate HTML that has reasonable indentation, but keep in mind
            the submit server ignores it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not use the System.lineSeparator() method. It creates a newline that will
            not allow you to pass tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the &lt;a&gt; tag any attributes go after the href attribute. If you add
            them before you will not pass tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML information can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/WebPageGen/IntroHTML.pdf">IntroHTML.pdf</a> and
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/WebPageGen/IntroHTMLCode.zip">IntroHTMLCode.zip</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The best way to understand what you need to implement is to study the public
            tests.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Classes</h3>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Do not wait until the day the project is due to submit your project for the
            first time.
        </li>

        <li>Verify that your project passes the submit server tests
            (<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2019">https://submit.cs.umd.edu/</a>)
        </li>


        <li>Keep in mind that for this project you have three release tokens in the
            submit server that regenerate every 12 hours. Information about the test
            types for CS course can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/utilities/testtypes/">Test Types</a>.
        </li>

        <li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> â†’ If you have a problem with your code
            and need assistance during office hours, you need to have a student
            test(s) that illustrates the problem you are experiencing.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests for this
            project.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a> for
            information
            regarding style.
        </li>

        <li>We cannot provide any information regarding release nor secret tests.
            Once your project has been graded, you can see a TA if you would
            like to find out why you failed a release or secret test.
        </li>
    </ul>
