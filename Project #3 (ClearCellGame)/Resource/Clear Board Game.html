            <strong>Project:</strong> Clear Cell Game<br>
            <strong>Due Date:</strong> Thursday, Sep 26, 11:30 pm<br>
            <strong>Assignment Type: </strong>Closed
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project you will implement code for a game named <strong>clear
        cell game</strong>. The game's goal is to maximize the number of cleared
        cells in a colored board. This is a closed project.</p>

    <p>We will provide the graphical user interface (GUI) and you need to develop
        the code that implements the rules of the game. A video illustrating the
        collapse game can be found at <a href="https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=838c6e27-f898-4856-9475-aacb0108fe99">Game Video</a>. Keep
        in mind that you can finish this project without ever playing the game through
        the GUI. Also, keep in mind that you should not debug your code using the GUI
        (student tests are preferable).</p>

    <p><strong>
        We want to remind you of the academic integrity rules associated with the course
        as a project similar to this one has been done in the past. Implement your own
        code and if you are having difficulties with the project, see us during office hours.

    </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <p>This project will allow you practice two-dimensional arrays, abstract
        classes, and test development. </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(20%) Public Tests</li>
        <li>(30%) Release Tests</li>
        <li><strong>(40%) Secret Tests </strong></li>
        <li>(10%) Style</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarifications</h2>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>
        The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/ClearCellGame.zip">ClearCellGame.zip</a>
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>gui package </strong> → Represents the graphical user
            interface for the game. Executing the main method of this class will
            allow you to play the game.
        </li>
        <li><strong>model package </strong> → Includes the classes you need to
            implement.
        </li>
        <li><strong>tests package </strong> → Includes the public test
            model.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Text files </strong> → Represent the expected output for
            public tests.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <p>You are expected to implement methods for the Game and
        ClearCellGame classes. The other classes have been provided and you should
        not modify them. You should familiarize yourself with the BoardCell class.
        The javadoc describing what you must implement can be found at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/ClearCellGame/doc/index.html">Project Javadoc</a>.</p>

    <p>Notice you are not required to write student tests for credit, however,
        if you need assistance during office hours you need to bring student tests
        that illustrates the problem you are experiencing. Also, keep in mind the
        percentage associated with secret tests is high, so you need to test your
        project thoroughly.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearing one cell represents one point.</li>
        <li><strong>Notice that when a cell is clicked, one or more rows might be cleared as a result.
            Your program must collapsed all those rows.</strong></li>
        <li>While checking the cells surrounding a particular one, do not use out of bounds
            exceptions to implement the expected processing. You should verify whether a particular
            cell access is legal or not before attempting such access.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional information about the game clearing rules can be
            found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/ClearCellGame/ClearingRules.html">clearing rules</a>. If you have any
            doubts about the clearing rules, please see us during office hours
            or in lecture.
        </li>
        <li>You may not use ArrayList for this project.</li>
        <li>You may not add any classes, but feel free to add any instance variables
            and private methods you understand are necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will not be graded in terms of code coverage information provided by the
            submit server, although having a high code coverage is highly recommended (and
            encouraged).
        </li>
        <li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> → If you have a problem with your code
            and need assistance during office hours, you need to have a student
            test(s) that illustrates the problem you are experiencing.
        </li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests for this
            project.
        </li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a> for
            information
            regarding style.
        </li>

        <li>We cannot provide any information regarding release nor secret tests.
            Once your project has been graded, you can see a TA if you would
            like to find out why you failed a release or secret test.
        </li>

        <li> The Random object parameter of the ClearCellGame constructor is a
            reference you will store as an instance variable of the
            ClearCellGame class. This object will be used while calling
            the getNonEmptyRandomBoardCell method of the BoardCell class.
            This is the only use you will have for this object (do not
            use it for anything else).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the Game.java class. Notice this class provides
            basic functionality for manipulating cells in a board.
        </li>
        <li>To test your Game.java class add ClearCellGame methods (even
            if they are not doing anything) that allows you to run
            public tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            The first public test is just displaying the board. You can
            see the board in the file pubEmptyBoard.txt. This test
            relies on the the private method getBoardStr (part of the public
            tests). Look at that code; you will see it makes use of Game
            methods.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once you have the Game.java class tested, move on to ClearCellGame.
        </li>

        <li>
            You will notice that the ClearCellGame has a constructor that takes
            a Random object. The only thing you need to do is to define
            an instance variable (e.g., random) that keeps track of the object
            passed in the constructor parameter. This is the object that
            is required by the getNonEmptyRandomBoardCell we provided.
        </li>

        <li>
            The nextAnimationStep method functionality is basically:
            <pre>            if (!isGameOver()) {
                /* insert random row */
            }
            </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
            When is the game over? When the last board row is different from empty row.
        </li>

        <li>
            To handle the code complexity, you should define auxiliary methods.  For example, a
            method that collapses a board can be helpful as you can test it independently.
        </li>

        <li>
            For this project when you collapse a board or perform any board operation,
            you can create a new array that represents the new board, instead of manipulating
            the original board / array.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For Fun</h2>
    <p>
        The following is not a project requirement; it is just for those that would like
        to have additional practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Add a new strategy (use number 2 for the ClearCellGame constructor) that clears
        cells in two steps. When a cell is clicked the first time, it will be cleared if it
        is green. If the cell has a color other than green, the first click will set it
        to green, and a second click will clear it.
    </p>

    <h2>Suggestions on How To Start the Project</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Study the public tests before starting implementing your project.</li>
        <li>Notice that you can implement this project without using the GUI at
            all.
        </li>
    </ul>
