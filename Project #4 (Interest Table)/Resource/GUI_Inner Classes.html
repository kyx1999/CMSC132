            <strong>Project:</strong> GUI/Inner Classes (Interest Table)<br>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this assignment you will implement a GUI for an interest table calculator.
        A video of a calculator that illustrates the functionality you need to implement
        can be found at <a href="https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ef41133-086c-4c40-bc0e-aad4016dd8f2">Video</a>.
        Notice that your GUI does not need to look like the video. Actually the one in the
        video was developed using Swing (yours will rely on JavaFX). About this project:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are no public/release/secret tests associated with this project.</li>
        <li>To submit your project you need to upload a zip file directly to the submit server (No "Submit
            Project" option is available).
        </li>
        <li>
            This is an open project.
        </li>
        <li>
            Feel free to use all the GUI code TAs discussed in lab (you can cut and paste).
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not use any GUI code from the web.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no good faith attempt for this project.
            You can choose not to implement it (yes, you will get a 0 in that case :))
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarifications</h2>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>For this project we are not providing any code. You need to create an Eclipse
        project named <strong>InterestTable</strong>. In that Eclipse project feel free to add any
        classes/packages you understand you need. To simplify the grading process, make
        sure you have a class named <strong>InterestTableGUI.java</strong>. This class must have a
        main method that allow us to run your application.
    </p>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <p>You need to implement a GUI that displays interest tables ranging from
        1 up to 25 years. The tables are generated by selecting the appropriate button
        and based on the principal, rate and years values provided. One table displays
        simple interest, the second compound interest and the third a combination of simple and
        compound interest. See the provided video for table format
        information.
    </p>

    <h3>Interest Formulas</h3>

    <p>The formula to compute simple interest amount is:</p>

    <p><em>simple interest amount = principal + (principal * (rate/100) *
        years)</em></p>

    <p>The formula to compute compound interest amount is:</p>

    <p><em>Compound Interest Amount = principal * (1 +
        rate/100)<sup>Years</sup></em> <br>
        <br>
        Notice that you do not need to add the principal in this case.</p>

    <h3>Displaying Currency</h3>

    <p>To display currency you can use the NumberFormat class (part of java.text)
        as follows: </p>
    <p>String formattedValue =
        NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(value);<br><br>
        where value represents the numeric value to format.
    </p>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can assume we will not resize your GUI.
            You don't have to worry about a GUI that adapts when
            the user resizes the window.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will not lose points if your GUI does not look exactly as in the video.
            As long as it is close, you are fine (75% is close enough :)).
            We are not going to penalize you because it is not well aligned, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unless the project specification states otherwise, you can assume all input will
            be correct (e.g., correct format, etc.)
        </li>

        <li>
            You can assume input has been provided when a button is selected.
        </li>

        <li>
            Nested/Inner Classes will satisfy the MVC Requirement.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can use JavaFX TableView.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may not use prompt fields instead of text fields.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can use String.format("%.2f", value) to format values.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can use java.util.Math.
        </li>
        <li>
            The code that computes interests should be implemented in a class
            (or classes) different from the ones implementing the GUI. If you follow
            this approach, you will satisfy the Model-View-Control paradigm associated
            with the project.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may NOT use Swing; you must use JavaFX.</li>

        <li>
            Make sure you have a class named <strong>InterestTableGUI.java</strong>. This class must have a
            main method that allow us to execute your application.
        </li>

        <li>No student tests are required for this project.</li>

        <li>Your project will be graded by running the main method associated with the InterestTableGUI.java
            class.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>You may not use any tools that generate the GUI code for you.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Optional</h2>
    <p>
        If you would like to provide additional functionality to your GUI or provide
        a nice/cool alternative, go head :); surprise us. Just make sure you develop it
        in a class other than InterestTableGUI.java; name it OptionalGUI.java.

    <h2>Submission</h2>

    <p>There is no "Submit Project" option for this project. You need to export
        your project (as a zip file) and upload it to the submit server. Information
        about exporting/importing Eclipse projects can be found at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/other.html">http://www.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/other.html</a>.

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

    <p>Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so
        you understand what is permissible in our programming assignments. We want to
        remind you that we check your work against other students' work and any case of
        academic dishonesty will be referred to the
        <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.</p>
