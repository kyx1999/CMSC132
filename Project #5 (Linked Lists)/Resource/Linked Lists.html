            <strong>Project:</strong> Linked Lists <br>
            <strong>Due Date:</strong> Tue, Oct 15, 11:30 pm / Mon, Oct 21, 11:30 pm<br>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project you will implement a basic linked and a sorted linked list.
        Notice that no public tests are part of this project as all tests are either
        release or secret. <strong>You must implement this project by yourself.</strong>
    </p>

    <p><strong>
        There are two deadlines associated with the project. Those deadlines are:</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Tue, Oct 15, 11:30 PM</strong><br><br>
        Your code must pass the first five release tests. These tests are associated with
        the BasicLinkedList class. That is the only requirement for this deadline. We will
        not grade the code for style. This first part is worth .5% of your course grade
        (NOT .5% of this project grade). Notice you can still submit late for this part.<br><br>

        <strong>Mon, Oct 21, 11:30 PM</strong><br><br>
        Final deadline for the project. Notice you can still submit late (as usual).
    </p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <p>This project will allow you practice linked lists and testing.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>(20%) Release Tests</li>
        <li>(53%) Secret Tests</li>
        <li>(15%) Student Tests</li>
        <li>(12%) Style</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/LinkedLists.zip">LinkedLists.zip</a>.

        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>listClasses package </strong>→ Where classes implementing linked lists will appear.</li>
        <li><strong>tests package </strong> → Where you should place your student tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You are expected to implement two classes: BasicLinkedList and SortedLinkedList.The javadoc describing
            what you need to implement can be found at
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/LinkedLists/doc/index.html">Project Javadoc</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            The linked list in our project has a head reference (pointing to the first element
            of the list) and a tail reference (pointing to the last element in the list).
            The next link of the last node points to null.
        </li>

        <li>
            Methods addToEnd(), getLast(), retrieveLastElement() rely
            (and must use) the tail reference.
        </li>

        <li>
            The head and tail must be set correctly when list operations
            update the list.
        </li>

        <li>You can use recursion for the implementation of methods.
        </li>

        <li>
            Two methods must be implemented using recursion: getReverseArrayList()
            and getReverseList(). You are allowed to add an auxiliary function (only one)
            during the implementation of a recursive method. You MAY NOT add any
            instance variables nor static variables to support the implementation of
            a recursive method. <strong>If you do, you will lose significant credit</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your code must be efficient. For example, you will lose credit if
            you perform an unnecessary list traversal(s) during the implementation
            of a method.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you see in the submit server the error "missing_component", the problem is that you
            are missing a required class. You can also get this error if you are not defining a generic
            class correctly. Submit often so you can identify this problem immediately.
        </li>

        <li>
            For student tests you can use other methods of a class (e.g., iterator)
            to write your tests.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can assume the data field of a node will not be null.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may not use any method of the Collections class (e.g., sort).  If
            you do, you will lose significant credit.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can fail several tests if your iterator implementation is incorrect.
        </li>

        <li>
            Feel free to use code we have provided in lecture.
        </li>

        <li>
            You are allowed to use the TestsSupport class from past projects during
            the implementation of student tests.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may add comparators to your student tests.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may add toString() and equals() methods to your classes.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may not use dummy nodes to implement the list.  Using
            dummy nodes the head always points to a node, even when the list
            is empty.
        </li>

        <li>
            You may not use the Java LinkedList class.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Student Tests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your student tests must include at least a test for each method of each class.
            Write tests as you develop your code and not at the end; this is the correct approach
            to develop student tests. Also, think how you can test your code so it will work with
            any data set. Hint: For a list, you can try inserting and deleting all the permutations
            for a set of numbers. This kind of hint is what you need to discover for future
            projects (and for your future job) by yourself.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>
            Your student tests must use assertions (e.g., assertEquals) to verify the tests works.
            Having a test that displays output, but does not rely on assertions will lose credit.
            </strong>
        </li>

        <li>
            You may not share your student tests with other students.
        </li>

        <li>
            JUnit testing information can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/eclipse/JUnitTesting.html">JUnit Testing</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remember that you can execute student tests using the debugger; this will help you identify
            problems.
        </li>

        <li>
            Feel free to use methods of the TestingSupport.java/SupportPublicTests.java classes that are
            part of previous projects if you think they can be helpful.  You are not required to use them.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have a problem with your code and need assistance during office hours, you
            need to have a student test(s) that illustrates the problem you are experiencing.
            See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests.
        </li>

        <li>
            The iterator you define may NOT be used to implement other list operations (e.g., add).
            The iterator is for users that want to iterate over the list.
        </li>

        <li>
            You need to implement a singly-linked list that relies on a head and a tail reference.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a>
            for information regarding style.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Honor's Section Requirement</h2>
    <p>
        The following requirement is for students enrolled in the honor's section.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the iterator's remove method for the BasicLinkedList class.</li>
        <li>Add a clone method to the BasicLinkedList class.</li>
    </ul>
    -->

    <h2>Sample Driver</h2>
    <p>
        The following driver and associated output provide an idea of the classes you need
        to implement.
    </p>

    <pre>

import listClasses.BasicLinkedList;
import listClasses.SortedLinkedList;

public class SampleDriver {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicLinkedList&lt;String&gt; basicList = new BasicLinkedList&lt;String&gt;();

		basicList.addToEnd("Red").addToFront("Yellow").addToFront("Blue");
		System.out.println("First: " + basicList.getFirst());
		System.out.println("Last: " + basicList.getLast());
		System.out.println("Size: " + basicList.getSize());
		System.out.println("Retrieve First: " + basicList.retrieveFirstElement());
		System.out.println("Retrieve Last: " + basicList.retrieveLastElement());
		System.out.println("Removing Red");
		basicList.remove("Red", String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
		System.out.print("Iteration: ");
		for (String entry : basicList) {
			System.out.print(entry + " ");
		}
		
		SortedLinkedList&lt;String&gt; sortedList = new SortedLinkedList&lt;String&gt;(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);
		sortedList.add("Yellow").add("Red");
		System.out.print("\n\nIteration (for sorted list): ");
		for (String entry : sortedList) {
			System.out.print(entry + " ");
		}
		sortedList.remove("Red");
		System.out.print("\nAfter remove in sorted list first is: ");
		System.out.println(sortedList.getFirst());
	}
}

Output

First: Blue
Last: Red
Size: 3
Retrieve First: Blue
Retrieve Last: Red
Removing Red
Iteration: Yellow 

Iteration (for sorted list): Red Yellow 
After remove in sorted list first is: Yellow
