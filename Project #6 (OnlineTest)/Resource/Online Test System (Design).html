    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project you will implement the data manager of an online test system. The system allows
        for the definition of exams with three possible kinds of questions: true and false,
        multiple choice and fill-in-the-blanks questions. The system will grade submitted exams
        and generate some statistical information.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice the design and implementation of object-oriented software
            systems.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(45%) Design</li>
        <li>(40%) Public Tests Only (No release/secret tests)</li>
        <li>(15%) Command Line Interpreter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarifications</h2>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/OnlineTest.zip">OnlineTest.zip</a>.
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A package named <b>cmdLineInterpreter</b> - Package where classe(s)
            that implement a simple command line interpreter for the System Manager will
            reside. We should be able to run your interpreter by running the main
            method of the <b>Interpreter</b> class. Additional details about this interpreter
            are provided below.
        </li><li>A package named <b>onlineTest</b> - Package where all the classes
            representing your design will be implemented.
        </li>
        <li>A package named <b>tests </b>- Includes the public tests
            (<b>PublicTests.java</b>). Notice that you are not required to write student
            tests for this project; however, we recommend you do so.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <h3>Data Manager</h3>

    <p>For this project you will implement the data manager (model component of
        the MVC paradigm) for an online test system. The system allows
        for the definition of exams with three possible kinds of questions: true and false,
        multiple choice and fill-in-the-blanks questions. The system will grade submitted exams
        and generate some statistical information. </p>

    <p>The functionality of the system you will implement is represented by the
        interface <strong>Manager</strong>. The interface
        represents the methods available to anyone trying to make use of the system.
        The javadoc documentation for the project can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OnlineTest/doc/index.html">javadoc</a>. Your task for the design part of the
        project is to come up with a set of classes and interfaces that together
        provide the functionality defined by the Manager interface.</p>

    <p>Access to the data manager functionality will be possible through a class
        named SystemManager that you must define. This class implements the
        Manager interface. Feel free to add any instance variables and
        private methods to this class. Public tests create an instance of
        the SystemManager class in order to test your system. </p>

    <p>Your design should make use of object-oriented design concepts (e.g.,
        generalization, specification, etc.) discussed in class. Keep in mind that
        having a large number of classes does not guarantee a better design grade.
        If you only implement the SystemManager class you will lose all the points
        associated with the design component of this project (even if the class
        provides all the expected functionality). We encourage you to discuss
        your design with your instructor or TA to make sure your design is a valid one.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An exam can have different types of questions (true/false, fill in the blanks, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
            We expect to see at least five classes/interfaces (SystemManager and four
            additional classes/interfaces) in your design. For this project, do not use
            anonymous classes (except for iterators). Notice that classes
            used for iterators do not count towards the minimum of five classes.
            In addition, classes associated with the command line interpreter are
            not included in this count.
        </li>

        <li>You can use any of the data structures discussed in class (e.g., arrays,
            arraylists, maps, sets, etc.) to keep track of your data.
        </li>

        <li>
            Your command line interpreter will provide access to a reduced set
            of the functionality of your system. You need to define a command
            line interpreter that allow us to:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a student</li>
                <li>Add an exam</li>
                <li>Add a true/false question</li>
                <li>Answer a true/false question</li>
                <li>Get the exam score for a student</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>Your command line interpreter will display a menu with
                the above options. Your interpreter should rely on standard input/output
                (not GUI/JavaFX).</strong>
            <br><br>
        </li>

        <li>Verify that your project passes the submit server tests (<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2019/">https://submit.cs.umd.edu/</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the following approach to compute average:
            ((examScore1/totalScoreExam1) + (examScore2/totalScoreExam2) + ...)/totalNumberOfExams
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests for this
            project.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a> for
            information
            regarding style.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you pass the public tests you should be OK in terms of implementing the
            expected functionality. There are details of the functionality that can be
            implemented in different ways.
        </li>

        <li>
            The provided Manager interface does not count towards five classes/interfaces needed.
        </li>

        <li>
            You will not be penalize if your code is not efficient, but try
            to make it as efficient as possible.
        </li>

    <p>Submit your implementation using the Eclipse "Submit Project" option
        (available by right clicking on the project folder).</p>

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

    <p>Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so
        you understand what is permissible in our programming projects. We want to
        remind you that we check your project against other students' projects and any
        case of academic dishonesty will be referred to the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.
