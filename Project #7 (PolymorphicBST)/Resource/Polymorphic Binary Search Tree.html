    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project consists of implementing the methods of the

        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/PolymorphicBST/doc/tree/PlaceKeysValuesInArrayLists.html">PlaceKeysValuesInArrayLists</a> classes.
        The complete javadoc for the project can be found at

    <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <p>The objective of this project is to implement a polymorphic binary search
        tree. This project is designed to help you develop your skills at recursion,
        polymorphism and testing.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(90%) Tests
            <ul>
                <li>(12%) Public JUnit tests</li>
                <li>(54%) Release JUnit tests</li>
                <li>(24%) Secret JUnit tests</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            (10%) Student Tests
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The project's code distribution is available at
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/PolymorphicBST.zip">PolymorphicBST.zip</a>.
        The code distribution provides you with
        the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A package named <b>performanceReport</b> - Includes an example of how to
            generate timing information. You can ignore this package (no performance
            report will be required).  We have left this information in case you would
            like to compare your implementation against Java's map classes.  Feel free to
            ignore the Javadoc entry for TreeSpeed.
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>tests </b>
        </li>

        <li>A package named <b>tree</b> - Includes the tree
            classes/interfaces.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Binary Search Tree Specifications</h2>

    <h3>Design</h3>

    <p>Notice that the insert and delete methods on Tree objects return references to
        Tree objects. In many cases, these functions may return a reference to the
        <b>this</b> object. However, in some cases they can't. For example.
        EmptyTree.getInstance.insert("a", "1") has to return an instance of an
        NonEmptyTree object.</p>

    <h3>Design and Implementation Restrictions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You may not use any form of looping construct.</li>
        <li>You may not use any arrays.</li>
        <li>You may not explicitly check a Tree to see whether it is an EmptyTree or
            NonEmptyTree.
        </li>
        <li>Your EmptyTree and NonEmptyTree implementations may not have any
            comparisons against the null value.
        </li>
        <li>You should not need to do any casting for this project. If you are
            casting, you are probably not using generic programming correctly.
        </li>
        <li>If you insert multiple values with the same key, only the value
            associated with the most recent insertion will be saved.
        </li>
        <li>You may not use any classes from java.util except ArrayList, Set and HashSet.</li>
        <li>You may not add any public methods.</li>
        <li>You may not check whether a tree is empty by using comparisons similar to
            the following:

            <ul>
                <li>left == EmptyTree.getInstance()</li>
                <li>tree.size() == 0</li>
                <li>Other comparisons similar to the above</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            You are expected to use polymorphism (and exception handling, where
            appropriate) to handle the differences between empty and nonempty trees.
            Failure to do so will result in a large negative adjustment to your project
            grade.
        </li>
        <li>You may not use Collections.sort for this project.</li>
        <li>You may not use instanceof.</li>
        <li>You may not use getClass().</li>
        <li>The delete method must use the approach described in the lecture slides.
            You may not implement delete by creating a new tree and inserting all the
            keys from the source tree except the one you want to delete.
        </li>
        <li>For the Subtree method you may not create an empty tree and traverse the
            whole tree inserting only those entries within the specified range. If a
            simple check will tell you that an entire subtree can be excluded, your
            implementation should not traverse that subtree.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>The above restrictions do not apply to your test cases; you may write
            them however you wish. </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify that your project passes the submit server tests (<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/">https://submit.cs.umd.edu/</a>).
        </li>
        <li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> â†’ If you have a problem with your code
            and need assistance during office hours, you need to have a student
            test(s) that illustrates the problem you are experiencing.
        </li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests.
        </li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a> for information regarding style.
        </li>

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

    <p>Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so
        you understand what is permissible in our programming projects. We want to
        remind you that we check your project against other students' projects and any
        case of academic dishonesty will be referred to the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">Office of Student Conduct</a>.</p>
