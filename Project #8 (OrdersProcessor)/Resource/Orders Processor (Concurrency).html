    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project you will implement a program that processes files that
        represent purchase orders. The program can complete the processing by using
        a single thread or multiple threads.  <strong>Before you post a question in Piazza regarding
        the project, make sure you carefully read the Requirements section of this description. It
            addresses typical questions students have about this project.</strong>
        Remember that we take academic integrity matters seriously.  You must implement
        this project by yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The project's code distribution has the following files/folders:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            example1.txt → A sample order.
        </li>

        <li>
            example2.txt → A sample order.
        </li>

        <li>
            example3.txt → A sample order.
        </li>

        <li>
            itemsData.txt → Information about the items that can be purchased.
        </li>

        <li>
            resultsExample.txt → Results of processing the above example1.txt,
            example2.txt, and example3.txt orders.
        </li>

        <li>
            processor package → This is where all the files associated with
            your implementation will reside.
        </li>

        <li>
            report package → This is where the Report.doc file can be found.
            Remember to refresh your project after editing this file (or overwriting it).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <h3>Processing of Orders (Files)</h3>
    <p>
        Your program will process a set of files (e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/example1.txt">example1.txt</a>)
        each representing a purchase order. Each file lists the items bought and the date
        of purchase. The possible items that can be purchased (along with the item's price)
        can be found in a item's data file (e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/itemsData.txt">itemsData.txt</a>).
        The program you need to write will generate a summary for each order (file). The summary includes
        the client id and a <strong>sorted list (by item's name)</strong> of each item bought. The list will
        include the item's name, the cost per item, the quantity of items bought, and the total
        cost associated with the item's purchase. After the sorted list, an order's total
        will be displayed. See the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/resultsExample.txt">resultsExample.txt</a> file
        for an example of the data format.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to a report for each order, the program will generate a summary of
        all orders. The summary will display a sorted list (by item's name) providing
        information about the total number of items sold, and total revenue
        (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/resultsExample.txt">resultsExample.txt</a>).
    </p>

    <h3>Threaded Processing</h3>
    <p>
        Your program will allow users to process all the orders using a single thread
        or one thread per order (file). For simplicity, all the orders will use the
        same base filename (e.g., <strong>example</strong> in the files above). The user
        will provide a filename for the results.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to see the advantages of threading, your program needs to print (to
        standard output) the time (in msec) it took to process orders. You can
        compute the time as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
/* TASK YOU WANT TO TIME */
long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Processing time (msec): " + (endTime - startTime));
</pre>

    <h3>Driver</h3>
    <p>
        Your are free to define any number of classes/interfaces you understand you
        need, however, you need to provide a class called <strong>OrdersProcessor</strong>
        in the processor package. This class can have as many methods as you want, but it
        must have a main method that allow us to configure/run the processing of orders.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your program will ask users how to configure a particular processing of orders by
        using standard input and output. The following represents a run of the OrdersProcessor
        main method that computed the results you see in
        <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/resultsExample.txt">resultsExample.txt</a>
        (code in italics represents user's input).
    </p>

    <pre>Enter item's data file name:  <strong><em>itemsData.txt</em></strong>    
Enter 'y' for multiple threads, any other character otherwise: <strong><em>y</em></strong>
Enter number of orders to process: <strong><em>3</em></strong>
Enter order's base filename: <strong><em>example</em></strong>
Enter result's filename: <strong><em>resultsExample.txt</em></strong>
Reading order for client with id: 1003
Reading order for client with id: 1001
Reading order for client with id: 1002
Processing time (msec): 51
Results can be found in the file: resultsExample.txt
</pre>

    <h3>Report</h3>
    <p>
        Using the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/data.zip">data.zip</a> file, create a table that
        illustrates the time it takes to process data using a single thread and
        multiple threads. For example, the table can have three columns where
        the first indicates the number of orders, the second the time it took
        using a single thread, and the third the time is took using multiple threads.
        Provide a brief explanation (no more than a paragraph) of your results.
        Put your table and explanation in a file named <strong>Report.doc</strong>
        you will find in the report package.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>
            You need to define a map/ArrayList that is shared and modified by all threads. How you use the
            map is up to you.
        </li>

        <li>
            Each order has an item name, followed by the date (e.g. 6/13) the item was
            ordered. That date is not used in your program.
        </li>

        <li>
            For the multiple threads option, one thread will be created for
            each order (file) to be processed.
        </li>

        <li>
            You will start the timing process immediately after reading the
            name of the results file and will stop the timing process before
            printing the message indicating where results can be found. Make sure
            you close the file output stream for the results file before you stop
            the timing process.
        </li>

        <li>
            Your program will print (to standard output, NOT to the results file)
            the message "Reading order for client with id: " followed by the client id,
            before reading a particular order's file.
        </li>

        <li>
            Notice that the reports appear sorted by client id, but the processing of
            each order (when using multiple threads) is up to the Java scheduler.
        </li>

        <li>
            The summary for all the orders only includes items that have been bought.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>You may not use classes that are automatically synchronized (e.g., StringBuffer, Vector).
            </strong>.  Instead of StringBuffer, use StringBuilder that has an API compatible with
            StringBuffer.
        </li>

        <li>
            Synchronizing individual methods is fine (in this case you many not need
            to use an explicit lock object), however, be careful as you don't want to limit
            concurrency while trying to avoid data races. Instead of defining
            a method as synchronized, you should surround the critical section with a lock.
        </li>

        <li>
            What we are expecting for the synchronization part of this project, is that any
            object (e.g., map, set, whatever you use) that is being shared is not
            associated with a data race.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>IMPORTANT: Before uploading your project to the submit server,
            remove all large data order files (.txt). Usually these are files you
            utilized for performance experiments. If you have student tests that rely
                on .txt files, keep those text files small. If you submission
                fails, try removing extra test files.</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
            Feel free to define as many classes and/or interfaces you understand are necessary.
        </li>

        <li>
            Your program must be able to process any number of orders (not just 3).
        </li>

        <li>
            Do not use static variables; do not use static objects. We want
            to avoid the JUnit problems discussed in class. Notice that using
            static methods is OK.
        </li>

        <li>You are not required to write student tests for this project, but you are
            strongly encourage to do so. Notice that you can write student tests where main is
            executed (by calling OrdersProcessor.main(null);)
            after you have redirected input. The file
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/TestingSupport.java">TestingSupport.java</a>
            has tools for writing tests (including input/output redirection). Notice
            you don't need to use these tools.
        </li>

        <li>
            Your code must be efficient and you must avoid code duplication.
        </li>

        <li>
            We plan to modify the contents of the item's data file while
            grading your program. That means we plan to use items other than
            the ones you see in the sample file.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can assume all order files will be placed in the same folder where
            example1.txt, example2.txt, etc. reside.
        </li>

        <li>
            The report for each client must be sorted by client id.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can assume that the specified output file (e.g.,
            <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/resultsExample.txt">resultsExample.txt</a>) will
            be overwritten (no appending of results) if the same name is used several times.
        </li>

        <li>
            We will use different names for output files (not just resultsExample.txt).
        </li>

        <li>
            There could be items in the items' data file that no one buys.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can assume orders will only have items present in the items' data file (no
            invalid data).
        </li>

        <li>
            The file names will always start at 1 up to including the number of orders.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remember that we are planning to use base file names different than order or example.
            For example, we can provide files names myNewOrder1.txt, myNewOrder2.txt, etc.
        </li>

        <li>
            To compare files in Eclipse, you can right-click on a file and select "Compare With".
        </li>

        <li>
            Remember to follow exactly (except for spaces) the format associated with
            the file <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/sampleFiles/resultsExample.txt">resultsExample.txt</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            To print currency use <strong>NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(AMOUNT_HERE)</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remember to refresh your project after editing/copying the Report.doc file.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style
            Guidelines</a> for information
            regarding style.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/OrdersProcessor/DataFilesGenerator.java">DataFilesGenerator.java</a> can be used to
            generate additional data sets.
        </li>
        <li>
            We don't have any specific time requirements.  There are many factors that can affect
            the performance (computer, what programs computer is running, etc.).  We expect
            the multi-threaded version to be faster, but we have seen that the single
            threaded version can be faster for some data sets.  Students will not
            lose credit for this as long they have not minimized concurrency by using
            locks incorrectly.   Trying a large data set with the data generator we posted could
            help see the advantages of multi-threaded version.
        </li>

        <li>
            For the single thread approach main count as a thread and you don't need to
            create any additional threads.
        </li>
    </ul>
