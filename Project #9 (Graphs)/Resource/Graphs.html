    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project you will implement the Breadth-First Search, Depth-First
        Search and Dijkstra's algorithms. Your project score will be based on submit
        server results. For this project you are not required to write student tests,
        but you are encourage to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice implementation of graphs.</li>
        <li>Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal.</li>
        <li>Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal.</li>
        <li>Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path computation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(100%) Tests
            <ul>
                <li>(35%) Public Tests</li>
                <li>(65%) Release Tests</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Clarifications</h2>

    <h2>Code Distribution</h2>

    <p>The code distribution for the project
        can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/zipFiles/Graphs.zip">Graphs.zip</a>.
        The code distribution provides you with the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A package named <b>graphs</b> → Package where the class you need
            to implement can be found. Feel free to add any other classes you understand
            are necessary, but make sure you place them in the graphs package. Notice
            that you are not required to add any additional classes (i.e., you will NOT
            lose credit by implementing everything in the Graph class).
        </li>
        <li>A package named <b>tests </b> → Includes the public tests
            (PublicTests.java).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <p>This project has two main tasks: Implementing a graph representation and
        implementing the BFS/DFS/Dijkstra's algorithms. Notice that the Graph class
        is a generic class whose type parameter represents the elements of the graph
        we are defining (e.g., Graph&lt;Student&gt;, Graph&lt;Double&gt;, etc.).
        In order to represent the adjacency properties and the graph data we will
        use the following maps:
    </p>
    <pre>HashMap&lt;String, HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; adjacencyMap;
HashMap&lt;String, E&gt; dataMap;
</pre>


    <p>The actual methods you need to implement are described at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2019/cmsc132/projects/Graphs/doc/index.html">javadoc</a>. You will find in the graphs package an
        interface named <strong>CallBack</strong>. A class implementing this interface
        represents a class that will process a vertex. An example of such a class is
        <b>PrintCallBack </b> (which you will find in the graph package). This class
        is used to generate the string that represents the path we follow when
        performing a breadth-first search or a depth-first search. Each time we reach
        a vertex, the implementation of DFS and BFS is expected to call the
        <b>processVertex </b> method to apply whatever processing needs to be done to
        the vertex. We have implemented <b>PrintCallBack</b> for you (don't modify
        it).</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>
            The method getCost returns the cost of the directed edge that exist between startVertex and endVertex.
            You can assume that endVertex is adjacent to startVertex. Notice this method is NOT computing the cost
            between any two vertices. For this method ignore the @throws IllegalArgumentException information provided
            in the javadoc.
        </li>

        <li>
            If your doDepthFirstSearch and doBreadthFirstSearch methods work in Eclipse, but not in the submit server,
            your problem might be that you are defining the callback parameter as PrintCallBack
            instead of Callback. The submit server expects Callback.
        </li>

        <li><b>Do not implement DFS using a recursive approach; implement DFS using
            an explicit stack as described in lecture.</b>
        </li>

        <li><b>
            If no path is found while executing Dijkstra's algorithm, the ArrayList representing
            the path will have the entry "None". The doDijkstras method will return -1
            in this case.</b>
        </li>

        <li>Verify that your project passes the submit server tests (<a href="https://submit.cs.umd.edu/fall2019/">Submit Server</a>). Those
            are the results we use to compute your grade.
        </li>
        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/studenttests/">Student Tests</a>
            for information regarding the implementation of student tests for this
            project.
        </li>

        <li>See <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nelson/classes/resources/javastyleguide/">Style Guidelines</a> for
            information
            regarding style.
        </li>

        <li>Notice you will receive points for release tests even
            if you don't release test your project (e.g., you ran out of tokens.)
        </li>

        <li><b>Process adjacent vertices in alphabetical order.</b><strong>
            This means that when processing a node you will add adjacent elements
            to a stack or queue by selecting adjacent nodes in alphabetical order.
            It does not mean the DFS or BFS result will show the nodes in alphabetical
            order. For example, if node B has nodes E and D as adjacents, we will
            add D to the stack/queue first, followed by E.
        </strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Style will not be graded for this project.
           Your grade will be based on the submit server results.
       </li>
        <li>For this project it could be the case that you pass your tests in
        Eclipse and not in the submit server due to some class definition.  Make
        sure you submit early and often so you can verify your project works
        in the submit server.  No extensions will be granted because you did not
        check your project results in the submit server.</li>
        <li>
            You can actually implement the project without using a particular maximum.
            In case Integer.MAX_VALUE is not working for you, you can assume an edge cost will not exceed 10000.
        </li>
        <li>Adding private methods is fine.</li>
        <li>
            Do you know you can make a TreeMap out of a HashMap?. You can have the
            efficiency of HashMaps, but when you need to process data in sorted
            order you can turn a HashMap into a TreeMap by using the TreeMap constructor
            (e.g., new TreeMap(myHashMap)). This hint has been brought to you by pepsi.
        </li>

        <li>
            When multiple nodes have the same cost choosing any one is fine.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can use classes we have gone over in class
            (TreeSet, PriorityQueue, cmsc132SuperHashSet, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>
